# Black Hole Physic Simulator

## A pygame simulator to showcase the physics that works around black holes

This is a physics simulator to show the physics that works around a back hole in as much detail as possible. Developed with inspiration from youtube tutorials.

- You can choose between two modes: interstellar and custom

- in interstellar, mode u will see a fixed size black hole.

- in cutom mode, u can change the mass of the black hole and metres per pixel of the simulation from settings

- in both the modes, you can generate light rays in ur desired directions

- there is interstellar background music playing in the background.

- overall a cool experience too see how light will be effected near a black hole.

## Requirements

To run this locally, you will need python3 and these libraries:

- pygame

- pygame_gui

you can install them using this command:

```
pip install pygame pygame_gui
```

## How to run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Turbash/fall
cd fall
```

2. Download the iamges and mp3 file from github and place them in the same directory as the source code.

3. Run the simulation python file:

```
python3 black_hole.py
```

## How to play the simulation

To play the simulation it is really simple u can choose between two modes, one is interstellar mode, which is really just fixed constants for u a black hole is already there and u have can create rays by using ur mouse clicks. And there is custom mode where u can make ur black hole with custom mass and also change the meteres per pixel of the overall simulation using the settings menu. If u want to go to previous menu from any mode or settings press Esc key on you keyboard. That is all for now.
